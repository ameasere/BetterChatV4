## Description

BetterChat V4 is a successor to BetterChat V3 after Roblox made changes to their Messaging Service, breaking the project entirely. While in development, BetterChat V4 was discontinued by the original author [@Jumpathy](https://github.com/jumpathy) and wished for a new author to continue the project. Please see the original thread [here](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/betterchat-v4-early-development/3243725). I am taking on the challenge of supporting and updating the project until I can't.
